# TrustyCore :heart_eyes:

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a simple git Repo that demonstrates how to get started with TrustyAI.
<h2>Installation :desktop_computer: </h2>

### Prerequisites :
  You will need üõ†Ô∏è - 

 * Git - 2.27.0 .
 * Docker - 20.10.3 .
 * Docker-compose - 1.25.2 .
 * Java - 11 :coffee:
 * Maven - 3.6.3

Just so you know, also previous versions of the applications might work, but they were not tested.

### Steps to complete setup üìãüñãÔ∏è :

  1. clone the kogito-examples Repository   :octocat:.
        
     `git clone https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples.git`

  2.  Check out the stable branch.

      `cd kogito-examples`  
       `git checkout stable`


## Compile and package in Local Dev Mode :electric_plug: :

  Build a new kogito decision service with the tracing-addon and the monitoring-addon. or you can compile and package already prepared service at.
  
  **Before building jar check for the embedded Maven version if you using any IDE.**  
  
  `mvn clean package -DskipTests -f dmn-tracing-quarkus/pom.xml`

### On successfully jar building :

Change the directory to -
`dmn-tracing-quarkus`


## Build :bricks: the Docker Image

Give this command to your cmd at the present directory.  

`docker build -t <your_namespace>/dmn-tracing-quarkus:1.0 dmn-tracing-quarkus/`

Now the docker image will be built.

## Run :running_man: the Kogito service together with the TrustyAI infrastructure :office:.

In order to do that, change your current directory to  

`kogito-examples/kogito-quarkus-examples/trusty-demontration/docker-compose`

With your preferred editor, edit the file docker-compose.yaml and replace the line 48 with the tag of the docker image you have just created.

## Run :running_man: the docker-compose command   
`docker-compose up`

with the above command, you will able to see that some data is downloading and pulling.
On successful pulling, there are some containers created.

### Now the services are available at the following endpoints:

* You can now open localhost:8080/swagger-ui

Execute some POST requests to the LoanEligibility with the following payload.

```
{
  "Bribe": 1000,
  "Client": {
    "age": 43,
    "existing payments": 100,
    "salary": 1950
  },
  "Loan": {
    "duration": 15,
    "installment": 180
  },
  "SupremeDirector": "Yes"
}

```

You should now see the executions in the AuditUI and the monitoring data in Grafana.
